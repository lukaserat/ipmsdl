            <p>The international Indigenous Peoples Movement for Self-determination and Liberation (IPMSDL) is comprised of indigenous leaders and advocates from different countries in Asia, Pacific, Australia, Africa, Europe and North America. IPMSDL was established in 8 November 2010.</p>

            <p>The IPMSDL stands for the right of indigenous peoples to govern ourselves and for liberation from imperialism, state oppression and human rights violations. It aims to uphold indigenous peoples’ rights to survival, self-determination, liberation and social justice. It works for the empowerment of indigenous peoples, and for the victory of the people’s will over the powers-that-be, while respecting the legitimacy and forms of struggle and self-determination that our peoples opt to employ.</p>
